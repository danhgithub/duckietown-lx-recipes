Each color component is a `float32` value from 0.0-1.0 that is mapped to the 0-255 color range.  For example, a red LED would be represented as `{r: 1.0, g: 0.0, b: 0.0, a: 1.0}`\n",
    "\n",
    "**How are we setting the intensity?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The intensity, or brightness, of each LED is defined by the `A` component of the `std_msgs/ColorRGBA[] color` in the `LED` message and can range from 0.0-1.0. `A` is a commonly added `RGB` component representing the `alpha`, or opacity, which translates to brightness in the LEDs.\n",
